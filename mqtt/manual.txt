Connection

                              ---sub-'temp','humid' ---> client (db server)
        <--sub 'humid'---    ||
client  ---pub 'temp'--->  server ---sub 'temp'---> client (arduino)
(sensor+arudiono)        (port 8883) 
                             /\
                             ||
                             ||
client  ---pub 'humid'---------   
(sensor)
- All client and server can both sub or pub 
- All client connect to server as center only via port '8883'  (easy to maintain, security )
- client connect to server in subject line called 'Topic' 
- publish topic mean send info regarding to that topic to server
- subscribe topic mean to get info regarding that topic from server 
- security TLS Encryption, Username&password, Optional Certification
- each client unaware of others (ip address, domain)
- broker server have backup(redundance server) when server offline or overload 
- MQTT broker software have many version, open-source as standard, or specific one for addtion feature 
  such as Sparkplug
- Retained Message from a client_A is kept at broker for some time (or use db server as client to sub & store message), 
  client_B can sub that message any time, even client_A go offline 
- Persistant Sessions , broker also keep track of each topic (which client pub, or which client sub) or
  or keep client-online-record   ==> al this info is loged in broker as session ==> 
  some client might go offline/loss connection server will know and when it come back online broker will
  send new info at the point where that client left off without client to resend sub 'topic'  again
- Normally when client_A first connect to broker, it will send 
  -birth, 
  - death, 
  -last will and testament  
  to broker  + with keep alive timer 
  and broker will send birth of client_A to other client let everyone know client_A is alive
  during client_A connection, it will send heartbeat to broker to let broker know it is alive as mention in keep-alive-timer
  also broker will send death of client_A to other client when client_B end 
- However if client_A disconnect unexpectedly it will not send hearbeat to broker, broker will know and 
  inform all client with last will and testament 

- when to interact with each other, client need sub to birth, death, lastwill
